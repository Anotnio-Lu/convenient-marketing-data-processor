# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

A marketing agency has hired me to refactor an existing website to make it more accessible, following the best practices for web accessibility. The challenge involves using semantic HTML elements, creating a logical structure for the elements independent of styling and positioning, adding accessible alt attributes to image elements, ensuring that heading attributes fall in sequential order, and creating a concise, descriptive title for the website.

## User Story
As a marketing agency, I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that my own site is optimized for search engines.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The webpage meets accessibility standards.
- The source code contains semantic HTML elements.
- The structure of the HTML elements follows a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
- Image elements have accessible alt attributes.
- Heading attributes fall in sequential order.
- The title element is concise and descriptive.

## Approach
In order to meet the acceptance criteria, i followed the Scout Rule, which recommends leaving the code a little cleaner than when you found it. I made sure to refactor the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

## Completed tasks
Below is a list of edits that have been made to improve the website:
- All links if navbar work
- Text Color changes when curser hovers over links
- Added comments that describe certain sections of code in the HTML page
- Replaced div elements with semantic HTML elements.
- HTML semantic elements follow a logical structure
- Added accessible alt attributes to the hero image element
- Addeed a concise, descriptive title to the HTML page.
- Used the Scout Rule to consolidated and organize CSS selectors and properties.


## Conclusion
By refactoring the existing website to meet the best practices for web accessibility, the marketing agency will improve its search engine optimization, avoid potential litigation, and provide a better experience for users with disabilities.
